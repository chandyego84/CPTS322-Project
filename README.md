# CPTS322-Project

## Team Name: Furious 7 Bookworms
### Project Title: A Librarian Assistant
### Project Description
A librarian assistant that helps a librarian manage common
library-management tasks, including user registration, book search, placing hold on a
book, checking out a book, and returning a book, etc. You may need to use a database
of book information to support this application. Users can also browse the books in the
library and look into the details about each book selected.

### Note to developers/the group
1. Always work on a separate branch from main: e.g., on branch 'lastName'
2. Make small commits to changes you make
3. BEFORE pushing your branch onto main:
    - run `git pull origin main`
    - fix any merge conflicts
4. `git push`
5. Create a Pull Request
    - Will not be merged until reviewed by Chandler!
